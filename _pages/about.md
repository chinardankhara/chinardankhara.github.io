Hi there! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I am a student Georgia Tech enrolled in the CS dual degree program. I am currently exploring retrieval systems, language models, LLM orhcestration tooling, and cloud infrastructure and delivery systems. I am also a developer for the NSF Open Knowledge Network project that is building the world's largest open source index of scientific works, authors, and grants. I work on the backend infrastructure and data pipelines that power the OKN.

I am not limited to to above topics. I have previously worked in genome analysis and edge computing, had a brief stint in mineral analysis, and I love securities valuation and have a minor in Economics from the Ivan Allen school at Georgia Tech. At heart, I am a builder and a tinkerer. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you have an interesting project or opportunity or just want to chat, please reach out to me!

In my free time, I like to play narrative based video games like Suzerain and 80 Days, brew and complain about coffee, and code personal projects or learn new frameworks.
