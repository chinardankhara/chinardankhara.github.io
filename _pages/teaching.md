Talent Acquisition Team \
Palantir Technologies 


Dear Talent Acquisition Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Forward Deployed Software Engineer position at Palantir, a company I admire for its commitment to harnessing data in transforming critical sectors. My journey in software engineering, marked by innovation and a knack for problem-solving, aligns seamlessly with the impactful work you do.

At Delta Airlines, my role in developing a groundbreaking speech-to-text system echoes Palantir's ethos of turning complex data into practical solutions. The project's success in enhancing cross-lingual communication mirrors the transformative impact I aim to achieve with your team.

My hands-on experience with AWS and Azure, managing massive datasets at NCR, directly relates to Palantir's dynamic, data-intensive environment. I've thrived in roles that require a startup CTO's agility - from architecting systems to coding custom solutions and setting strategic directions.

One of my personal projects, Evocal, demonstrates my ability to blend technical skill with creative thinking. Its unique approach to integrating event detection with calendar management, using serverless architecture, is precisely the kind of innovative solution I'm excited to bring to Palantir.

The Forward Deployed Software Engineer role excites me as it resonates with my passion for using large-scale data to solve real-world problems. My experience in Python, Java, and C++, coupled with a strong foundation in Computer Science, aligns with the technical demands of the position. Moreover, my eagerness to collaborate with diverse teams and adapt to evolving challenges fits perfectly with Palantir's dynamic work environment.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity at Palantir to engage in projects with significant global impact. My philosophy of 'strong opinions, weakly held' has always propelled me to innovate while remaining open to new ideas and approaches - a mindset I see mirrored at Palantir.

I am enthusiastic about the chance to discuss how my background, innovative approach, and commitment to impactful technology can contribute to the cutting-edge work at Palantir Technologies.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and making a real difference in the world through our work.

Warm regards, \
Chinar Dankhara
